                        Black Swan Inn is a lush, 35-acre home and wedding venue cloaked by 100-year-old oak trees in
                        San Antonio, Texas. While it's a romantic scene ideal for nuptials, it's also allegedly infested
                        by the spirits of those who've lived and died on the property. Built in the mid to late 1800s on
                        a plot of land where, 50 years earlier, 60 Mexican soldiers were killed in the Battle of Salado,
                        the Greek Revival manor has had a plethora of owners, many of whom were prominent San Antonio
                        socialites and are also said to still be lingering there in the afterlife.

                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">Once operated as a dairy farm, the barn behind the primary residence is the most haunted building
                        on the property. Many of the earlier occupants, including members of the Rippstein and Mahler
                        families, spent their lives there. Later occupants included sisters Katherine Holbrook and
                        Blanche Woods, Katherine's husband (who died at the home), and Blanche's children and
                        grandchildren. Almost all of them are said to haunt the estate.</p>

                        actually a functional inn, she does partner with local ghost tour companies and has invited
                        paranormal investigators in over the years. Some theorize that perhaps the paranormal activity
                        is being caused by a particularly menacing anchor item: a porcelain doll (Rivera is an avid

                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify first-letter:text-5xl first-letter:mr-2 first-letter:float-left">This Mayan Revival home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright Jr., the son of the legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright towers over Franklin Avenue at the bottom of the Los Feliz foothills. While its unique architectural character is certainly noteworthy, arguably the most interesting thing about the home isn't necessarily the block-style facade, which was inspired by the menacing yet beguiling opening of a cave or an ancient tomb.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">After it was built in 1926 for photographer John Sowden and his young family, the house enjoyed years of hosting bohemian parties for Hollywood's in-crowd. But when Dr. George Hodel moved into the house in 1945, its fate as the potential crime scene of America's most notorious cold case, The Black Dahlia, was sealed. Though the murder of Elizabeth Short remains unsolved to this day, by 1950, Dr. George Hodel became one of the prime suspects in her tragic case, and many true crime buffs are convinced that he carried out the crime right inside this iconic Los Feliz mansion.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">The home also went through a few stages of abandonment in the late 20th century, making it even more mysterious and spooky to passersby. According to Steve Hodel, former occupant, retired LAPD investigator, and son of Dr. Hodel, several onlookers have noted its haunting trappings. According to Steve, "in the 1970s, [the Hodel housekeeper] returned to the [Sowden] House and informed the then current owner 'this is a house of evil,’” and on another occasion, Edmund Teske pointed to the house saying, "It's an evil place. Artists, philosophers, accountants, and politicians all played and paid there. Murders happened there. It's an evil place." During the same era, Dr. Hodel's daughter Tamar went inside the home and claimed to see the spirit of a young woman in the basement. Years later, in 2016, Ghost Adventures host Zak Bagans investigated the Sowden house with Tamar's daughter Fauna, who claimed to see the exact same spirit her mother did.</p>

Their four children—and two friends who were spending the night—were also murdered, and to this day, the crime remains unsolved. Their home is considered one of the most haunted houses in the country, and guests have been drawn to visit it for years. (People pay $400+ to stay for one night).

Only a few short months later, after reportedly experiencing the worst residential "demon infestation" since The Amityville Horror, Ammons brought her family to the emergency room in an attempt to help free them of demonic possession. After extensive evaluations by police, members of the local church, hospital staff, and the Department of Child Protective Services, the witnesses were torn: half of them believed the house was infested by spirits and demons, and that the family was genuinely possessed by something paranormal, while the other half blamed psychological issues.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">Just like the best-selling book about the Amityville house turned into a national sensation, this modern instance of demonic possession went viral. The good news is that the Ammons family was able to find peace when they moved to Indianapolis, but the story, and the house itself, were still getting tons of attention.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">Ghost Adventure host and paranormal investigator Zak Bagans bought the property from Ammons's landlord in 2014 to shoot pseudo-documentary footage inside. Even though Bagans proceeded to tear it down, the Ammons House is about to get even more press. Oscar-nominee Lee Daniels is directing a film based on the story, The Deliverance. It's set to stream on Netflix in 2024 and will feature Stranger Things star, Caleb McLaughlin.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify first-letter:text-5xl first-letter:mr-2 first-letter:float-left">Starting strong with a very scary house: The Lemp Mansion in St. Louis, which is known to be one of the most haunted places in America due to its tragic history and links to a wealthy beer baron. Adam Johann Lemp, a German immigrant, was the first person to produce and sell lager-style beer in the U.S. He stored the barrels in an underground cave system beneath the city to keep them cool pre-modern refrigeration. It was successful, but his son, William Lemp, is the one who really brought it to the next level.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">In the 1860s, William Lemp wanted to live closer to the industrial plant and start a family with his wife Julia, so they built the foreboding home in the historic Benton Park neighborhood right over the cave system (we smell a haunting!). Everything seemed to take a turn for the worse in the new millennium, and William Lemp died by suicide in 1904 after his favorite of five sons, Frederick, died tragically due to complications of tuberculosis.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">A few years later, his wife also died of cancer in the house. In 1920, the youngest daughter, Elsa Lemp, mysteriously died in her home (not the Lemp Mansion) Then, in 1922, after running the company for years and seeing it flounder during the Prohibition era, William Lemp Jr., shot himself in the same room William Sr. died in. One of William Jr.'s brothers, Charles Lemp, lived in the home from the 1930s until 1949 when he shot his own dog in the basement of the home before dying by suicide in his room. That same year, the youngest surviving Lemp child, Edwin, sold the house and transformed it into a boarding house, where reports of hauntings began. According to Destination America, witnesses have experienced burning sensations, slamming doors, disembodied moaning and crying, amongst other things. Today, the Lemp Mansion is a restaurant and inn that also holds events, including weddings, Murder Mystery Dinners, and even ghost-hunting experiences.</p>

In the 1970s, famed preservationist and antiques dealer Jim Williams restored the home to its former glory after years of neglect.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">This Italianate revival played host to three untimely deaths, including that of 11-year-old Tommy Downs when he fell off the roof in 1969, the 1981 fatal shooting of Danny Hansford by Williams, and Williams himself, when he died in the same room as Hansford less than a year after being acquitted of Hansford's death in a fourth trial. If the story sounds familiar, it's probably because you recognize it from the bestselling book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">Much like the rest of the city, the home was supposedly built right on top of unmarked graves. Rumors about the crime and ensuing ghost stories continue to swirl to this day.</p>

In 1932, it was home to the iconic actress Jean Harlow and her abusive husband, Paul Bern, who shot himself in the head while standing in front of the mirror. Their butler discovered him and called MGM instead of the police, so there were tons of rumors that it wasn't actually suicide. Many suspected Bern's ex-girlfriend, a suspicion exacerbated by her jumping off a boat to her death a couple of days later. Jean moved out after his death but died only a few years later at the age of 26.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">But wait—it gets creepier. In 1963, celebrity hairstylist Jay Sebring bought the home and lived there with his girlfriend, Sharon Tate, until she left him for Roman Polanski. They were still friends and remained so until both of them were murdered by the Charles Manson cult. Tate was the same age as Harlow when she passed.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">But back to when the couple lived in the Harlow House. Tate told several friends of creepy occurrences in the home and even mentioned it in interviews. For example, once, when she was sleeping in the master bedroom alone, she saw a "creepy little man." Her friends say she believed it to be Paul Bern's ghost. She was so freaked out when she saw the alleged ghost that she ran out of the room and then saw a hanging shadowy corpse with its throat slit in the hallway. There are also stories about two other people dying in the swimming pool over the years.</p>

The original occupant, Sylvestor Pierce, had just started making his fortune in the furniture business when he built this home for himself, his son, and his wife, Susan. As a man about town, he hosted many notable people in his 7,000-square-foot home throughout the years, including President Calvin Coolidge, Bette Davis, and Norman Rockwell.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">Only a week after moving into the home, Susan fell ill and passed away from a mysterious bacterial disease. A year later, he remarried Ellen, a woman thirty years his junior, and had two more children. Years later, when both Sylvester and Ellen had passed away, his sons embarked on a fiery feud about the property as well as the furniture company, but the Great Depression swept in and made their choice easier since the company basically went bankrupt.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">The youngest son, Edward, was given control of the home when he turned it into a boarding house. It became a hotspot for illicit activities (including the murders and sudden, tragic deaths of several occupants) according to local lore. As a result of these violent ends, guests have reported every kind of haunting imaginable, from visions of apparitions to flying objects, disembodied sounds, pressure, temperature drops, and more.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">Fortunately, his eldest daughter let out a scream when he struck her in the head, waking up the younger children who then walked into the hallway to find out what was going on. During the commotion, they were all able to flee. Before the murder-suicide, he was a successful doctor who invented a new type of syringe after investing most of his money into its research and production. Still, he got screwed out of the rights, leading investigators to blame financial problems. Other creepy details include a passage from Dante's Divine Comedy left open on his bedside table.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">Two years later, it was sold to the Enriquez family, who used it as a "storage unit," and their son continued to do so until he sold it to a couple in 2016 who had plans to fix it up. But it seems to have scared them off because, within a few years, it's on the market again. Photographers also report a feeling of needing to "run away" from the house when they get close up to it.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2 leading-[23px] text-justify ">First, the architect died a year after construction. Then in 1862, Count De Vecchi came home to discover his wife murdered and his daughter missing. When he could not find her after a year of searching, he died by suicide. His brother then moved into the home and his family continued to live there until WWII. It's been vacant since the 1960s, and an avalanche in 2002 wiped out all the houses in the area... except this one. Spooky.</p>
